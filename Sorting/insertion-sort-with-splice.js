/* Algorithm -

A) Loop from i = 1 (second element of the array) to n-1.
B) Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence arr[0â€¦i-1]
C) Say I get 12, 11 as the second and third element. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12

    C> Note, < arr.splice(j, 0, 'item')  > means that at j-th position I am placing the 'item' and removing zero element.
